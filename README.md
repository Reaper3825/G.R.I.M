//G.R.I.M's Background
Grim's origin comes from my and im sure other's absolute annoyance with software maintenance/upkeep; from updating apps and "cant find file" errors even though you you put it there 5 seconds ago but Noo it doesnt exist, somehow or full storage can't download from app from steam or even update. How about when you are trying to clear up some space and you want to remove files that are taking up half your drive but you dont know what it does so you dont want to remove it and it break your pc(Trust don't remove those files had to wipe my OS like 6 times unrelated). With Grim you can say grim clean this folder or drive it will then prompt you with what you want to keep i.e keep files needed by my os or only delete files that havent been used in the last 30 days. Grim will go through check for dependincies and with the power of AI will find those files see if you need them may even ask if you need them if not you can move to trash or fully delete it via your wishes.
This is where Grims existence comes from a complete AI's existence dedicated to sorting out files
